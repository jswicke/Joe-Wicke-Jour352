                        It is one thing to drive through the grasslands of northern New Mexico. It’s quite another to
                        walk through them. When the winds are relatively calm and there are clouds in the sky, the
                        prairie stretches meditatively ahead, flanged here and there with glimmers of illumination. It
                        may look like nothing but grass and light, but on foot you can see the prairie’s rich wildlife
                        community — a herd of pronghorn antelope grazing in a prairie dog town, or a Say’s phoebe
                        flycatching while letting out a plaintive pee-ur. The very fortunate might see the queen of
                        grassland birds: the long-billed curlew, Numenius americanus, which arrives here in the spring
                        from Mexico, the Gulf Coast, or even Central America, depleted after flying hundreds of miles in
                        just a couple of days.

                        Grasslands are gorgeous ecosystems. The shortgrass prairies of northeastern New Mexico brim with
                        blue grama and buffalograss — perennial grasses whose roots stabilize the soil — and a subtle
                        multitude of wildflowers. Over the last two centuries, though, the flat, fertile grasslands of
                        North America have been razed for agricultural development: The American Bird Conservancy
                        estimates that 51.3 million acres in the Northern Great Plains have been plowed under and
                        replaced with cropland. In 2018 and 2019 alone, nearly 600,000 acres of Northern Great Plains
                        grasslands — an area almost the size of Yosemite National Park — were converted to fields of
                        wheat, corn and soy.

                        Like many grassland birds, long-billed curlews nest directly on the ground. They tend to choose
                        open, flat expanses with very short grasses; curlews are territorial during the breeding season,
                        and a single pair will fiercely defend an area of 100 acres or more. Once their young hatch,
                        curlews may use taller grasses to shield the chicks from the elements and from predators such as
                        coyotes, snakes and ravens. When grasslands are commandeered for crops or fragmented by
                        residential development, curlews lose the habitat they need for breeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though the long-billed curlew was once abundant in North America, in 2016 it landed on the North
                        American Bird Conservation Initiative’s “Watch List” of species most in danger of extinction
                        without significant conservation efforts. The initiative’s 2022 report confirms a narrative of
                        population decline among grassland birds: Species such as the mountain plover and
                        chestnut-collared longspur have lost more than 75% of their populations since 1970. “Since the
                        1960s, we’ve lost more than 40% of grassland birds,” Steven Riley at the American Bird
                        Conservancy told me. “A lot of grassland birds are in dire condition today.” Today, an estimated
                        140,000 long-billed curlews breed in grasslands ranging from northeastern New Mexico to southern
                        British Columbia, but they continue to be threatened by habitat loss and, in some places, by the
                        use of pesticides and rodenticides, which can kill not only the grasshoppers and other insects
                        that curlews depend on but also birds themselves.

                            On Memorial Day last year, my husband, Michael, and our two girls and I hiked in the Rio
                            Mora National Wildlife Refuge without seeing a trace of a long-billed curlew. Not even a
                            cry. There were other birds — western meadowlarks in yellow-and-black sang throatily from
                            fence posts, and horned larks with schoolgirlish headbands scuttled in the dirt, looking for
                            grass seeds. Long days spent observing birds are like a yatra — a pilgrimage. A naturalist,
                            I’ve been watching and studying long-billed curlews for more than two decades, and I know
                            not to expect an appearance simply because I’m in the field in the right season.
                            Transcendent experiences, after all, are rare.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After driving an hour north of Rio Mora, we turned west toward the town of Cimarron,
                            following back roads. The afternoon light was translucent, playing in the sky like musical
                            notes, with clouds gathering in tones of gray and the deep blue retreating until the billowy
                            gray clouds all but devoured the sky. We drove past private grasslands, and I scanned the
                            prairie for curlews until my eyes hurt.
                        </p>
                        <p>Then, in a mass of sage-gold grass, I spotted an unmistakable decurved bill.</p>
                        <p>I gasped. “I saw a curlew!”</p>
                        <p>“Should I turn around?”</p>
                        <p>“Yes!”</p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as Michael pulled over to the shoulder of the road, I moved toward the two-foot-tall
                            curlew. A second curlew, perhaps its mate, stood in the same field, some 30 feet to its
                            right. The pair screamed almost in unison, determined to scare me away. I suspected that
                            they had a nest nearby; as part of the courting ritual, the male scrapes a shallow nest in
                            the ground, and the female later lays a clutch of four mottled eggs in the depression. Maybe
                            this pair had chicks, since neither parent seemed to be sitting on a nest. Cur-lee! Cur-lee!
                            The female’s spectacularly extended bill, over eight inches long and more curved at the tip
                            than her companion’s, moved almost robotically as she opened it wide, emitting shrill
                            staccato cries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pair flew over me, arcing across the road and screeching as they flew. Then they soared
                            into the field on the other side, never far above my head. Soon, I saw another pair of
                            curlews flying over the second field. Four curlews! As the first pair landed, I saw the
                            female deftly pluck a grasshopper from the ground and swallow it. Moments later, she downed
                            another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I had to pick one bird species to venerate, it would be the curlew. The reasons are
                            partly anthropomorphic — these large, gangly birds are fiercely protective of their young,
                            and the fathers stay behind to rear the chicks after the mothers fly on to central Mexico or
                            some other wintering grounds. Though curlews are monogamous, a paired male and female may
                            spend the winter in different places before returning each spring to the same grassland to
                            breed. Talk about a couple giving each other space! The pair rears the chicks for the first
                            two or three weeks; after the mother leaves for her wintering grounds, the father stays
                            until the chicks can fly away from the nest site, usually another two or three weeks.
                            Compare the devotion of curlew fathers to, say, hummingbird dads, who typically have nothing
                            to do with chick-rearing.

                            A sunbeam broke through the clouds, and the curlews kept flying against the shifting
                            skylight. The first two curlews returned to the field. Fat raindrops began to fall, and,
                            reluctantly, I returned to the car. Moments later, I saw a flash of lightning dancing a jig
                            in the sky.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I soon trooped back toward the curlews, who were patrolling the field while mechanically
                            letting out their cur-lee cry. Deep in the grass, nearly camouflaged, I glimpsed a small
                            bird. A chick? No, a horned lark. By this time, my own chicks had come out into the rain and
                            were watching and listening to the curlews, almost as mesmerized as I was. Light whirled
                            about, gray, silver and blue. I might have been Dorothy in Oz, standing alongside a Good
                            Witch — Mia, whose blessings on our road trips are de rigueur — and my not-at-all Cowardly
                            Lion, brave Pika. That afternoon has stayed with me like a shining crystal, reminding me why
                            I live a bird-filled life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Northern New Mexico, the area’s three national wildlife refuges are islands in a sea of
                            private ranch and farmland, about 16,000 acres altogether in a region where a single ranch
                            can cover more than 100,000 acres. Last summer, I’d looked for curlews on the wildlife
                            refuges and, as in previous summers, found them mostly on nearby ranches instead. So, this
                            spring, Michael, our two girls and I embarked on a road trip from Santa Fe to learn how
                            ranchers are providing habitat, in some cases inadvertently, for the largest shorebird on
                            the continent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The curlews’ cries rang out within me in March, when we stopped at the visitor center of the
                            Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge. I was looking for Eric Spadgenske, the supervisor of the
                            Northern New Mexico National Wildlife Refuge Complex. A lanky, middle-aged man with
                            close-cropped hair, Spadgenske has an air of efficiency mingled with Southern charm. He had
                            hiked with us last year at the Rio Mora Wildlife Refuge, and Mia and Pika shyly pointed out
                            a photograph from the hike that was showcased in the visitor center. I told Spadgenske that
                            I planned to look for curlews on private ranches during this year’s road trip, and he nodded
                            approvingly. Rio Mora hosts one or two curlew pairs each year, but given the species’ large
                            breeding territories, two pairs are “probably close to saturation” for the small refuge, he
                            said.

                        <p>
                            After we left the visitor center, I birded at nearby Melton Pond, eyes lingering on American
                            avocets and common mergansers, before heading across the town of Las Vegas to the Mallette
                            Farm. A couple of weeks earlier, a pair of local hikers had enthusiastically recommended it
                            to me as a place where they had spotted some migratory birds, so I figured that the farm
                            must be doing something right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The family’s land is located at the northern edge of town, within the traditional homelands
                            and hunting grounds of many Indigenous peoples, including Apache, Pueblo, Comanche and Ute
                            communities. The 800-acre farm has been in the same family for 120 years, and Shirley
                            Mallette, the current matriarch, was minding the feed store when I arrived. Soon, we were
                            talking sandhill cranes and long-billed curlews; her adult son, who stood nearby, nodded,
                            affirming that in years past he had seen curlews in the farm’s pastures. Like many local
                            landowners, the Mallettes let native grasses, including blue grama and sacaton, grow
                            everywhere. In wet years, they seed their 150-acre pasture with oats, wheat and alfalfa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Mallettes lease their pastures to neighboring cattle owners, and, in the summer, a keen
                            observer can sometimes spot long-billed curlews foraging alongside the cattle who graze
                            there. Badgers, elk and burrowing and barn owls share the land, too. An added attraction for
                            wildlife in this dry climate is the farm’s 150-acre-foot holding pond, used mostly to
                            collect rainwater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mallette’s kids grew up playing in the pasture; once they were adults, however, they all
                            left to live in Denver and other cities. “But then it dawned on them that they couldn’t have
                            their horses and dogs,” she chuckled. In time, all came back and are now active in the
                            farm’s management. When a middle-aged man walked by, she said, “That’s Tim, the baby of the
                            family.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I asked about pesticides, Mallette said, “We’ve never used them” on the pasture. Like
                            many other farms in the 1940s and ’50s, though, they sprayed DDT inside their farm buildings
                            to control flies. Years later, her husband, Pete, and her mother-in-law lost most of their
                            hearing, which Shirley Mallette blames on their long exposure to the spray (research has
                            linked the use of some pesticides to hearing loss). Since then, she said, her family has
                            avoided pesticide use entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite the loss of his hearing, Pete Mallette has had a long life; he recently turned 90.
                            While I spoke with his wife, he brought over her walker so that she might perch on it.

                        <p>
                            The next morning, my family and I went for a hike in the Rio Mora refuge before driving an
                            hour north to Cimarron. We didn’t take the back roads, the way we did last June, because the
                            curlews had not yet returned from their wintering grounds. The inn where we stayed was
                            adjacent to a mountain ridge, and during our first night, the spring winds moaned and
                            wheezed, chilling the room. I woke early to the sight of grasses fluttering in the cold,
                            unrelenting wind. Even the staid juniper trees were dancing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wind had scarcely eased when we arrived at CS Ranch, which is stunningly laid out below
                            the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. In front of the main ranch house, Julia Stafford was feeding
                            a flock of wild turkeys; she and her siblings represent the fourth generation of ranchers in
                            the family, and I would later meet the sixth generation — her sister Kim’s granddaughters,
                            the eldest one in grade two. My own third-grader, Pika, wandered about, petting the dogs
                            Hank and Belle and watching the turkeys eat the seed Stafford had scattered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Pika and Mia stayed near the house with Kim and her granddaughters, Stafford drove
                            Michael and me through parts of the 110,000-acre ranch, where the family raises cattle,
                            breeds horses, and offers guided hunts for antelope, deer and elk. Stafford and her sister,
                            Kim, grew up on this ranch along with their four brothers, all of whom remain actively
                            involved in ranching. Out in the pastures, curlews were beloved birds; the family has always
                            tried to give the birds space. Stafford has only happened upon curlew nests a handful of
                            times. “My father was a real bird-watcher and enthusiast, and he would always watch for them
                            in the spring,” she remembered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stafford pointed out a variety of grasses growing in the ranch: blue grama and galleta grass
                            are the most common, but there is also sideoats grama, little and big bluestem, coarser
                            grass such as alkali sacaton, and, especially in natural depressions, vine mesquite grass.
                            “The blessing of this area is that (much of it) was never plowed,” Stafford said. “So the
                            land is a natural seed bank.”

                        Robert Sivinski, who spent two decades as New Mexico’s state botanist, later told me that native
                        grasses such as blue grama and buffalo grass can take a beating by cattle and persist. He added
                        that ranchers often think non-native grasses will produce more beef, since they can grow faster
                        and create more biomass, but they tend to be less nutritious than the natives. “It’s important
                        to have a native ecosystem for native wildlife, including invertebrates, who are the base of the
                        whole food system,” Sivinski stressed. I’ve seen firsthand why native grasshopper populations
                        are crucial to curlews: The birds need a whole lot of grasshoppers to feed their growing chicks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Staffords carefully manage their grasslands, following advice from groups that focus on
                        grazing in arid regions, such as the Quivira Coalition and the Savory Institute; they move their
                        cattle frequently to avoid overgrazing, and mow the pastures early in the season, when it’s less
                        likely to disrupt ground-nesting birds. “The native species have always been here, but they’re
                        just really expressing themselves in all of the pasture,” Stafford said. “That’s been a hugely
                        satisfying thing for me, to watch the diversity of all the rangeland species becoming a more
                        common sight.” In 2018, the family worked with the New Mexico Land Conservancy and the Natural
                        Resources Conservation Service to place an 8,000-acre conservation easement on part of their
                        land.

                        The shortgrass prairie at CS Ranch can host as many as three pairs of breeding curlews. They
                        hadn’t arrived yet, but I spotted a horned lark, a bird I often see in similar seasons and
                        habitats, flying in short bursts. The diversity of grasshoppers and other insects in the grass
                        made me suspect that CS Ranch doesn’t use pesticides, which Stafford confirmed. “We’re fortunate
                        that there’s not a whole lot of insect pressure on the cattle or the native prairie,” she said.

                        The curlew is part of an interdependent community that needs functioning grassland ecosystems
                        that stretch across hundreds of thousands of acres. Keystone species like bison and prairie dogs
                        keep grasslands open, creating nesting habitat for grassland birds. While I was looking for
                        curlews last summer, my daughter Pika was hoping to get a good look at a herd of more than a
                        hundred bison we had glimpsed only fleetingly on nearby private land, their bodies glistening in
                        the morning sun. “Let me know if you see them,” she said, scanning the fields. During hikes at
                        the Rio Mora Refuge, I usually came upon a herd of bison and their young belonging to the Pueblo
                        of Pojoaque, grazing there thanks to a partnership between the refuge and the tribe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even people who don’t care about bison or curlews might note that grasslands, which sequester
                        impressive amounts of carbon, keep the planet functioning and habitable for all of us. But it
                        bears repeating that climate change is not the main cause of the decline of grassland species
                        like the long-billed curlew; the primary culprit is still habitat loss, and the North American
                        grasslands are one of the most at-risk habitats in the world.

                            >North American Grasslands Conservation Act,</a
                        >
                        introduced in the U.S. Senate in July 2022, attempted to create a coordinated strategy for
                        conserving grassland ecosystems across the continent, much like existing strategies for
                        sagebrush and wetlands. Relying on a voluntary, incentive-driven program, the act endeavored to
                        encourage the planting of native grasses and removal of invasive species, along with wildfire
                        and drought mitigation and soil carbon sequestration. While the act failed to make headway and
                        hasn’t been reintroduced, incentives for grassland conservation are offered to landowners
                        through the Department of Agriculture’s Grassland Conservation Reserve Program as well as
                        various state programs. In northeastern New Mexico, the High Plains Grassland Alliance also
                        advises landowners and ranch managers on wildlife stewardship.

                        Botanist Sivinski has witnessed the consequences of private grasslands management, for worse as
                        well as for better. “One rancher in Hidalgo County in New Mexico drained his cienega and planted
                        the nonnative weeping lovegrass instead,” he told me. “Then the cattle didn’t like it. And he
                        regretted doing what he did because the lovegrass turned into a weed. … It’s hard to get that
                        diversity back, and the species that aren’t there anymore.” But he also recalled the shortgrass
                        prairie on the DeHaven Ranch in northeastern New Mexico, where the owner, a retired
                        schoolteacher, managed her orchard and a small herd of cattle to ensure good grass cover,
                        varying soil depths and a variety of species. The DeHaven has woody vegetation, too, including
                        native oaks, and that has created a patchwork of habitats that benefit a variety of wildlife.
                        The ranch also has “prairie mounds” — low, naturally occurring hillocks — and when it rains,
                        water pools between the mounds. “That is where I saw my first and only long-billed curlew,”
                        Sivinski said, growing radiant and solemn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I nodded, understanding. Since my long-billed curlew sighting last June, I have tracked curlew
                        footprints in Oregon, Utah, California and even western Alaska, where the bristle-thighed curlew
                        migrates in the spring. But the sighting in Cimarron still has a special resonance for me. The
                        very next afternoon, we’d returned to that grassy field, and I saw the head and bill of one of
                        the previous day’s curlews sticking out of the grass. This time, we stopped only briefly to
                        minimize the disturbance. Still, the ever-alert female began to call. A couple of minutes later,
                        the male flew back, his rufous wings touching down in the sage-gold grass. I imagined that the
                        chick or chicks waited camouflaged in the grass between the parents. A horned lark, perhaps the
                        same one I’d seen in the grass yesterday, was now on a fence and soon ducked back to the ground.
                        The two curlews remained about 30 feet apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A car whizzed by, and the driver glanced curiously at me. As I stood there in jeans and a
                        T-shirt, I probably seemed to be staring at nothing but a sea of grass. The driver didn’t hear
                        Mia speculate that the male curlew had likely gone to get some insects and, upon seeing our car
                        stop nearby, the female had called him back. As Mia stitched together our field observations,
                        her eyes lit up, and I knew that she, too, had been touched by the wonder of curlews.
